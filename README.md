# Sentiment Analysis with Pretrained Albert Model

The project aim to demonstrate pipelines of sentiment analysis research. In this projet use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT). BERT is Transformers based, a deep learning model in which every output element is connected to every input element, and the weightings between them are dynamically calculated based upon their connection. Use case in this project to demonstrate sentiment analysis for comments.
